Key questions such as:<br>
When do most bookings occur?<br>
Which vehicle types generate more revenue?<br>
What payment methods are most commonly used?<br>
Which locations and time slots drive demand?<br>
are not easy to answer without structured analytics.

Gives a clear overview of Uber’s booking and revenue performance.<br>
Analyzes demand by time, day, and hour.<br>
Compares vehicle types and payment methods.<br>
