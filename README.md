### 5. Features / Highlights
•  Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms like Uber generate large volumes of trip data, but raw data alone makes it difficult to quickly understand booking trends, peak hours, revenue performance, and customer behavior across time and locations.

Key questions such as:

When do most bookings occur?

Which vehicle types generate more revenue?

What payment methods are most commonly used?

Which locations and time slots drive demand?

are not easy to answer without structured analytics.

•  Goal of the Dashboard

To provide an interactive analytical tool that:

Gives a clear overview of Uber’s booking and revenue performance

Analyzes demand by time, day, and hour

Compares vehicle types and payment methods

Helps support operational planning and data-driven decisions
